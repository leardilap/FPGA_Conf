# FPGA configuration using the Impact batch mode

## Usage
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
./fpga_config.sh -f FILENAME.bit
```

Simply replace FILENAME by the actual name of the file you want to configure.

Take in mind modifications to the impact_batch_tmp.cmd may be required for your specific system, simply run Impact once using the Graphical mode, and note all lines in the log which have the "Batch" word and write them to your own impact_batch_tmp.cmd file.
